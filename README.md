# Autonomous-Buggy
Code for an autonomous Arduino buggy which will follow a track while avoiding obstacles
The Autonomous Buggy UI folder contains a UI which I designed as well as a file containing code related to a programme
     in processing which starts and stops the buggy while displaying data such as speed.
The Autonomous Buggy.ino file is the main file which is uploaded to the buggy itself. It is uploaded to the Arduino which is the main processor of the buggy.
